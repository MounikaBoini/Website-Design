# Website-Design
Responsive Cafe website created using HTML ,CSS, JS, BOOTSTRAP 4

# Overview
This is basically a Responsive Web design of a Cafe which is created using HTML,CSS,JS and Bootstrap 4.
The built-in classes of Bootstrap are used mostly in this project to make images, tables, navigation bar and other html elements responsive.
I have linked the Bootstrap 4 using Bootstrap cdn link and also I have used font-awesome 4 icons in the project.
